# Introduction:
This is the firmware for my open source pwm controlled brake module. It's designed with esk8 in mind but can be widely adapted.
Is has an 5V 3A onboard buck converter and an Arduino Nano to controll it all. 
The shematic can be found here:
It's pretty simple to set up so here we go:

# Setup
1) Download the lastest firmware from the release tap: 
2) Unzip the downloaded archive.Install Arduino IDE and the FASTLED Library (if you don't know how to just do a quick little google search)
3) Connect your arduino to the comupter and upload the pwm_readout programm. Now open up the serial monitor using a baudrate of 11520.
